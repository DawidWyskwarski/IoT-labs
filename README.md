Note: The `.pio/` directory (containing build artifacts and library dependencies) is automatically generated by PlatformIO and is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## How to Build

This project uses PlatformIO for building and uploading code to microcontrollers. Follow these steps to build the project:

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) for VS Code

### Build Steps

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Click on the PlatformIO icon in the sidebar
3. From the PlatformIO menu, select "Build" to compile the project
4. To upload to your device, select "Upload" 

### Selecting Source Files

The project is configured to let you specify which files should be included in the build. In [`platformio.ini`](platformio.ini), modify the `build_src_filter` section:

```ini
# platformio.ini
[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
; ...other settings...

; Default: build all .cpp and .c files in src directory
build_src_filter = -<> +<*>
```

To build a specific file, change these lines to:

```ini
; Build only a specific file
build_src_filter = -<*> +<specific_file.cpp> 
```

For example, to build only the temperature sensor code:

```ini
; Build only temperature sensor code
build_src_filter = -<*> +<temperature_sensor.cpp> 
```

This approach allows you to maintain multiple Arduino sketches in the same project while building only the one you're currently working on.

### Using Wokwi Simulator

For simulation without physical hardware:

1. Install the [Wokwi for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wokwi.wokwi-vscode)
2. Press F1 and select "Wokwi: Start Simulator"
3. The simulator will use the circuit defined in [`diagram.json`](diagram.json)
